    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another format or representation. In data science, data encoding is useful in various ways, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compression: Encoding can help to compress data, reducing its size and making it easier to store and transfer. For example, run-length encoding is a simple compression technique that replaces repeated occurrences of a value with a shorter code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization: Encoding can help to standardize data, ensuring that it can be processed and analyzed consistently. For example, encoding categorical data as numerical values can make it easier to apply mathematical and statistical models to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy and security: Encoding can also be used to protect sensitive data by transforming it into a form that is difficult to understand or decode without proper authorization.\n",
